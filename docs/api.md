# Trooba API

- **`use`** `(handler[, config])` - adds a handler to the pipeline
  - _`handler`_ - a `function handler(pipe) {}` or another pipe to join into
    this pipe.
  - _`config`_ is a config object for the handler
- **`build`** `([context])` - creates a pipe and returns a generic pipe object.
- **`set`** `(name, value)` - used set system value to the context. The name is
  prefixed with '$' that prevents it from being propagated beyond the current
  pipe context boundaries.
- **`get`** `(name)` - is used to get system value from the context.

### Pipe API

The pipe object is passed to all handlers and transport during initialization
whenever new context is created via trooba.build(context) or
pipe.create(context) call.

- **`create`** `([context], [customApiImpl])` - creates a pipeline with new
  context or clones from the existing one if any present. The method is
  mandatory to initiate a new flow, otherwise the subsequent call will fail.
  - **`context`** is a context object to be used in request/message flow.
  - **`customApiImpl`** is a name for a specific API implementation. It allows
    to inject custom API provided by one of the handlers that needs to be
    returned instead of the generic pipe interface.
- **`context`** - is an object available to all handlers/transport in the same
  request/response flow. One can use it to store data that needs to be shared
  between handlers if needed. The values in the context that have their names
  started with '$' will not be propagated beyond the pipe boundaries. To access
  context one can use pipe.context;
- **`link`** `(pipe)` - links passed pipeline to the current one. The link
  between pipes exists as long as the context where they were linked exists.
  Once pipe.create is used, it will lose the link. The linking can be useful to
  join pipes on the fly, for example to bootstrap pipe from config file and
  inline it into existing pipeline where bootstrap handler is registered.

```js
Trooba.use(function bootstrapPipe(pipe) {
  // load all the handlers from some json or config file
  var handlers = []; // assume it is loaded as an array
  // build the pipe or load from cache
  var bootstrappedPipe = handlers.reduce((trooba, handler) => {
    return trooba.use(handler);
  }, Trooba).build();
  // link it
  pipe.link(bootstrappedPipe);
});
```

- **`request`** `(requestObject)` - creates and sends an arbitrary request down
  the pipeline. If context was not used, it will implicitly call _create_ method
- **`respond`** `(responseObject)` initiates a response flow and sends an
  arbitrary response object down the response pipeline. This can be called only
  after the request flow is initiated.
- **`resume`** `()` - resumes the processing in the given pipe point in ordered
  flow whenever the current message/response/request flow was paused due to
  processing of the ordered message and it was suppressed/swallowed, i.e. no
  throw/response/request/next action followed.
- **`streamRequest`** `(requestObject)` - creates and sends an arbitrary request
  down the pipeline. If context was not used. It returns write stream with
  methods:
  - **`write(data)`** - write a chunk to the stream as "request:data" message
  - **`end()`** - ends the stream and send "request:end" message
- **`streamResponse`** `(responseObject)` - initiates a response stream flow and
  sends an arbitrary response object down the response pipeline. This can be
  called only after the request flow is initiated. It returns write stream with
  methods:
  - **`write(data)`** - write a chunk to the stream as "response:data" message
  - **`end()`** - ends the stream and send "response:end" message
- **`send`** `(message)` - sends a message down the request or response flow
  depending on the message type. For more details see message structure below.
  The method can be used to send a custom message.
- **`throw`** `(Error)` sends the error down the response pipeline. If no error
  hooks defined in the pipeline, it will throw error. The method can be called
  only after the response flow is initiated.
- **`trace`** `([Function callback(err, listOfPoints)])` - used to trace the
  route that any message would travel, it uses `message.type = 'trace'` and
  returns a list of point it traveled in request/response flow.
- **`set`** `(name, value)` - sets arbitrary system key-value pair to the
  context which will not be explicitly propagated beyond transport boundaries as
  internally the name will be prefixed as $name. It is used to provide custom
  API by handlers.
- **`get`** `(name)` - reads system value from the context.

#### Message

The framework defines a message bus to send and receive messages within the
pipeline.

The current message structure:

- **`type`** - a `String` that defines a message type which can be used in
  pipe.on() and .once()
- **`flow`** - a `Number` that defines flow type. It will define the direction
  of the message in the pipeline
  - `1` - request
  - `2` - response
- **`ref`** - a reference to the data being sent in the message
- **`sync`** - a `boolean`, if equals `true`, the message will be propagated to
  all pipe points at the same time, no callback is needed to control when to
  send it to the next handler in the pipeline.
- **`order`** - a `boolean` value that controls order, if set to true, the
  message will be queued at any pipe point if similar ordered message is already
  in process by the given point.
- The rest of the fields will be assigned by the framework and should not be
  changed

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "flow": 1,
  "ref": "[Error: some error message]",
  "sync": true
}
```

**Note:** Since Trooba framework is based on message propagation through the
pipeline, it uses time-to-live (TTL) parameter to limit the time the message can
travel through the pipeline. By default it uses Infinity for TTL, but you can
configure it using config.ttl parameter.

When a message is expired, it will be dropped through console.log by default or
you can intercept it by registering your own onDrop handler to the context

```js
// set TTL to 2 seconds
pipe.build({
  ttl: 2000, // msec
  onDrop: function (message) {
    console.log("dropped message:", message);
  },
});
```
